# Gaurav's Portfolio Space

Hello ðŸ™‚, welcome to my portfolio page.

I am Gaurav Kumar, an senior undergrad @ NIT Surat, and a upcoming software engineer.
I love to tackle problems that push my toughts and skills beyond my current capabilities and this habit of mine has helped me grow at all stages of life.
At the moment I am figuring out various software practices that may help me become a pragmatic and agile engineer, so if you have got any suggestions for me, please let me know!!
Well, I am still building it and updating it to include all the possible updates from my education, career or some personal stuffs, feel free to check it out.

Any feedbacks and criticisms are the portfolio are more than welcome, feel free to let me know or raise a issue in this repository itself.
